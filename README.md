# 04 - NEST, a Data-driven Building Model
## Summary
Predictive building modelling to improve building operation.

## The Goal
Energy consumption and CO2 emmissions of buildings could be reduced significantly by improving the controlling of the heating and cooling systems. This must be done predictively due to the thermal inertia. Hence, the control requires an accurate prediction model.

## The Challenge
The Empa team proposed this challenge (https://hack.opendata.ch/project/672) for the ENERGY &amp; CLIMATE HACK 2021. Starting point was a research project on data predictive control. The proposed challenge was to improve the statistical modelling of the correlations between building controls and resulting room temperatures.
